# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics

## Objective
To implement Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the Global Electronics companyâ€™s data and provide actionable recommendations that can enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

## Requirements
- Python: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- MySQL: For data management, data storage and querying.
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
